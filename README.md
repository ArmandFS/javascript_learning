# javascript_learning
This repository will be a recorded documentation of me studying Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course. I consider myself intermediate using Python, and C, as well as HTML and CSS, but I will try to challenge myself by studying JavaScript, as it is an industry standard language and is flexible with a lot of applications and systems. Along the lines, I will create separate repositories for large-scale projects.
